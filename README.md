Automated Power Infrastructure Fault Detection using YOLOv8
Overview

Inspection of power transmission infrastructure is critical for maintaining a reliable electricity supply. Traditionally, this inspection is done manually or with helicopters, which is expensive, slow, and sometimes dangerous.

In this project, we build an end-to-end computer vision system that automatically detects faults in power infrastructure from aerial (UAV) images using YOLOv8.
